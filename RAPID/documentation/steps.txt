To improve your calorie per day predictor model, considering age, gender, height, weight, and activity level, here are some suggestions:

1. **Normalize or Standardize Data**: Ensure all numeric features (age, height, weight) are on a similar scale using normalization or standardization. This step helps in preventing features with larger ranges from dominating the model training process.

2. **Handle Categorical Variables**: Encode categorical variables like gender into numerical values (e.g., 0 or 1 for male/female) to include them in the model.

3. **Check for Outliers**: Outliers in features like weight or height can skew predictions. Consider removing outliers or using robust methods that are less sensitive to outliers.

4. **Feature Selection**: Use techniques like correlation analysis or feature importance to select the most relevant features. This step can help in reducing overfitting and improving model performance.

5. **Regularization**: Implement regularization techniques (e.g., Lasso, Ridge regression) to penalize large coefficients, which can also help in mitigating overfitting and stabilizing predictions.

6. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Besides R-squared and MSE, consider Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and examine predictions visually through residual plots to understand where the model may be failing.

7. **Data Quality**: Ensure data quality by checking for missing values and ensuring consistency in data formatting.

Hereâ€™s a summary of the parameters you should consider:
- **Numeric**: Age, Height, Weight (after normalization or standardization)
- **Categorical**: Gender (encoded as 0 or 1)
- **Target**: Calories per day
