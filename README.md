Abstract: India is home to a substantial number of diabetic patients with it’s prevalence only increasing over the years. 
Lack of awareness and care can lead to deterioration of the condition. 
In this paper, we tackle the challenge by providing personalised lifestyle recommendations for diabetes patients. 
An individual’s diet is observed to have a significant impact on their diabetes management. 
In a diverse country like India it is also important to take into consideration the heterogeneous food habits. 
Cuisine varies throughout the regions and subregions of India. We proffer daily meal plans to the patients taking into account their food preferences and the region of India they are from while also keeping it diabetes friendly. 
An additional lifestyle factor to control diabetes is exercise. 
We provide workout plans to the patients for betterment of their health.
